# Automated Invoice Generator & Email Sender

Project Overview
This project will automatically generate invoices in PDF format using client data from a CSV or database and send them via email to respective clients. It will also store a record of sent invoices.

Key Features
Read Client Data from a CSV or database (Name, Email, Invoice Items, Amount).
Generate Invoices dynamically in PDF format using reportlab or pdfkit.
Send Emails with invoices attached via smtplib and email.message.
Log Sent Invoices in a local database (SQLite or a simple log file).
Error Handling & Retry Mechanism in case of failed email delivery.
Tools & Libraries Required
pandas (for reading CSV data)
reportlab or pdfkit (for PDF generation)
smtplib and email.mime (for email sending)
sqlite3 (for storing records)
schedule (to run the script automatically at a set time)
Steps to Build
Extract Data: Read the client details from a CSV file.
Generate Invoice: Create a formatted invoice in PDF.
Send Email: Attach and send the invoice via SMTP.
Log Transactions: Store details of sent invoices in a database.
Schedule Automation: Run the script daily/weekly using schedule or cron.

### Automated Invoice Generator & Email Sender

#### Step 1: Extract Data (CSV or Database)
You’ll start by collecting client data. The simplest way for this project is by using a **CSV file** with columns like: `Client Name`, `Email`, `Invoice Items`, `Amount`.

- **Goal**: Read the CSV, extract relevant details for each client, and store them in a usable format.
- **How to Approach**:
  1. Use the `pandas` library to load the CSV. It’s great for manipulating tabular data.
  2. Each row will represent a client and their invoice details.
  3. Extract necessary fields (like name, email, items, amount) and store them in a list of dictionaries or a pandas DataFrame.
  4. Optionally, if you want to take this a step further, you could use an SQLite database to store this information and query it instead of using CSVs.

#### Step 2: Generate the Invoice (PDF)
Once you have the data, the next step is to generate the invoice. This involves creating a clean, structured layout for each client’s invoice.

- **Goal**: Dynamically create a PDF invoice for each client.
- **How to Approach**:
  1. Use a library like `reportlab` or `pdfkit` (with HTML to PDF conversion). These libraries allow you to define a layout and add text, tables, and other graphical elements.
  2. Design a basic invoice template, including the company’s name, client info, list of items/services, amounts, and total.
  3. For each client, create a function that takes in their details (name, items, total) and generates the invoice PDF.
  4. Store the generated invoices in a directory for later use or attachment.

#### Step 3: Send the Invoice (Email)
Once the invoice is generated, it’s time to email it to the client. You’ll be attaching the generated PDF and sending it over SMTP.

- **Goal**: Attach the PDF invoice and send it via email.
- **How to Approach**:
  1. Use `smtplib` for sending the email and `email.mime` for attaching the PDF.
  2. You'll need to connect to an SMTP server (like Gmail's, or another provider) and authenticate with your email credentials.
  3. Use `MIME` to construct the email message (subject, body, attachment).
  4. Attach the generated PDF file to the email and send it to the respective client’s email.
  5. Handle possible errors (e.g., invalid email, server downtime) and implement a retry mechanism in case of failure.

#### Step 4: Log the Transaction (Database or File)
After sending the email, you should store a log of the sent invoices for tracking purposes.

- **Goal**: Record the details of each sent invoice.
- **How to Approach**:
  1. Use a lightweight database like SQLite to store the following: `Client Name`, `Email`, `Invoice Date`, `Invoice Status` (sent or failed).
  2. Alternatively, you can use a simple log file (text or CSV) to record this information.
  3. You’ll update the log once the email is successfully sent, or log errors if it fails.
  4. This log will help keep track of which invoices have been sent, and when, for future reference.

#### Step 5: Automate the Process (Scheduling)
Finally, you’ll want the script to run automatically, either daily or weekly, so that it’s not a manual process.

- **Goal**: Automate the execution of the script.
- **How to Approach**:
  1. Use the `schedule` Python library to set up periodic task execution. You can specify when you want the script to run (e.g., daily at 9 AM).
  2. Alternatively, if you’re working on a server, you can schedule the task with `cron` (on Linux/Mac) or `Task Scheduler` (on Windows).
  3. When the scheduled time arrives, the script should loop through the clients, generate invoices, and send emails.

#### Putting it All Together
Once you’ve completed the steps individually, you’ll want to integrate them into a single cohesive script:

- Load the client data (from CSV or database).
- Generate the PDF invoice for each client.
- Send the email with the invoice attached.
- Log each transaction (success or failure).
- Schedule the script to run periodically.

#### Tips to Keep in Mind

- **Error Handling**: It’s crucial to handle potential issues, such as failed email deliveries or missing client data. Make sure to have fallback mechanisms in place.
- **Testing**: Start by running the script for just one or two clients to ensure it works before scaling up to the entire list.
- **Security**: When using SMTP, consider storing email credentials securely (use environment variables or a configuration file, not hardcoded in the script).

Here’s a good file structure for this project:

    invoice_automation/
│── invoices/                 # Folder for storing generated PDF invoices
│── logs/                     # Folder for log files (email logs, errors, etc.)
│── config/                   # Configuration files (e.g., email credentials)
│   │── settings.json         # Stores SMTP server details, sender email, etc.
│── data/                     # Folder for input data
│   │── clients.csv           # CSV file containing client data
│── src/                      # Source code for the project
│   │── __init__.py           # Marks this folder as a package
│   │── data_loader.py        # Reads client data from CSV or database
│   │── invoice_generator.py  # Generates invoices in PDF format
│   │── email_sender.py       # Sends emails with invoices attached
│   │── logger.py             # Handles logging of sent invoices/errors
│   │── scheduler.py          # Automates the script execution
│── main.py                   # Main script that ties everything together
│── requirements.txt          # List of dependencies (pandas, reportlab, etc.)

Breakdown of Each File & Folder

1️⃣ invoices/
Stores all generated invoice PDFs.
Each invoice file can be named like Invoice_JohnDoe_2025-01-29.pdf for clarity.

2️⃣ logs/
Stores log files that keep track of email deliveries and errors.
Example: email_log.txt to track sent invoices.

3️⃣ config/settings.json
A JSON file that holds configuration settings like:
{
  "smtp_server": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "smtp_port": 587,
  "email_sender": "your_email@gmail.com",
  "email_password": "your_password"
}

This avoids hardcoding credentials in the script. Consider using environment variables instead for security.

4️⃣ data/clients.csv
Contains client information in a structured format:

Name,Email,InvoiceItems,Amount
John Doe,johndoe@example.com,"Product A, Product B",100.00
Jane Smith,janesmith@example.com,"Service X",200.00

src/ (Main Code)
Each module handles a specific responsibility:

data_loader.py → Reads and processes client data from clients.csv or a database.
invoice_generator.py → Creates PDF invoices using reportlab or pdfkit.
email_sender.py → Sends invoices via email using smtplib.
logger.py → Logs all sent emails and errors in a structured format.
scheduler.py → Runs the script automatically at scheduled intervals using schedule.

6️⃣ main.py
The main entry point that ties everything together.
Calls functions from src/ modules in a structured workflow:
Load client data
Generate invoices
Send emails
Log transactions

7️⃣ requirements.txt
Lists all dependencies needed for the project:
pandas
reportlab
smtplib
schedule

Install them with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

README.md
Explains how to install, configure, and run the project.
Provides an overview of the functionality.

Why This Structure?
✅ Modular: Each functionality is separate (data loading, invoice generation, email sending).
✅ Scalable: Easy to add new features (e.g., different invoice templates, more automation).
✅ Maintainable: If something breaks, you can debug specific parts without affecting the whole project.
✅ Secure: Credentials and logs are stored separately, reducing risks of hardcoding sensitive data.
